## Project Overview

**Project:** Gamification platform

**Client:** UCB Pharma Ltd

**Sector:** Healthcare

Exploring the intersection of design, technology, and gamification, we developed UCB Impact Aid. This innovative tool aimed to align efforts, boost engagement, and enhance sales performance and execution.

## Our Team

- Dane Tatana: Strategy Lead
- Richard Watt: Client Lead
- Lara Reis and Khris Tubay: UX/UI Designers
- Costis Los: Delivery Lead

- Gareth Matson: Front End Development

## The Challenge

UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, grappled with complex issues central to growth and performance enhancement:

- Enhancing alignment and communication between marketing and sales teams
- Bolstering execution in support of strategy
- Boosting customer interactions
- Improving consistent and disciplined CRM data entry
- UCB sought innovative solutions, and JOURNEY answered the call.

## Our Solution

Over a four-month period, we co-created the Impact Aid using agile sprints. This gamified digital tool provided end-users - primarily sales and medical teams across Europe - with practical, timely information and resources to drive customer interactions. The platform motivated users through challenges, leaderboards, and awards, creating a spirit of competition that drove positive behaviors and activities.

The result? Significant increases in customer-facing activities during a strategic event, the EULAR Congress.

### Innovation and Uniqueness

The Impact Aid was not merely a gamification tool. It had distinctive features that made it a game-changer:

- Business KPI Alignment: Every challenge in Impact Aid was tailored to support UCB's KPIs for the EULAR Congress. We personalized challenges by role and adjusted them according to varying customer activities throughout the event.
- CRM Data Driven: Together with UCB's IT and CRM teams, we designed a data strategy that integrated the CRM with Impact Aid. This allowed for personal dashboards, progress trackers, and dynamic leaderboards at different organizational levels.
- A Blend of Practicality, Relevance, and Fun: The Impact Aid combined gamification with practical tools, including resources for customer conversations and timely nudges and notifications.

## User Experience

Impact Aid represented a fresh approach for UCB. Its user-friendly UX, contemporary UI, and competitive features engaged end-users effectively. Moreover, its embedded resources created an experience that was both practical and enjoyable, encouraging optimal activities to maximize customer opportunities.

## Marketing Success

Impact Aid enjoyed a resounding success, with 80% of the target population registering and actively using the tool. The pre-Congress phase witnessed a 180% increase in customer interactions compared to the previous year, with post-Congress phases seeing an uplift of over 200%.

Users viewed over 1,200 resources within the Impact Aid across its 160 users, while CRM completion rates increased by 29% to 98% across different countries.

Due to the success of the MVP, UCB plans to further develop Impact Aid's functionality in 2023, making it an ongoing driver for strategic events and initiatives.
